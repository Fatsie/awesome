SYZYGY is a free to license interface specification for low cost, compact and high-performance connectors that economize the pin count available in FPGAs. See section *Interface comparison* in [syzygyfpga.io](https://syzygyfpga.io/) for a reference of where does SYZYGY fit, between [PMOD]({{< ref "/items/pmod" >}} "PMOD") and [FMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FPGA_Mezzanine_Card).

There are few development [boards]({{< ref "/boards" >}} "boards") ([carriers](https://syzygyfpga.io/carriers/)) and [peripherals](https://syzygyfpga.io/peripherals/) with SYZYGY connectors yet. An open source carrier design is [ButterStick](https://github.com/hdl/constraints/blob/main/board/.todo/ButterStick.yml). However, there are PCB templates for KiCAD and Altium available for anyone to use (see [SYZYGYfpga/pcb-templates](https://github.com/SYZYGYfpga/pcb-templates)).
