The Adafruit Feather are a line of development boards from Adafruit that are standalone and stackable. Typically powered by lipo batteries or through USB, feathers are flexible, portable and light. Daughter boards or peripheral boards for feathers are named *wings*.

Apart from Adafruit's feather and wing ecosystem, there are several open source FPGA development [boards]({{< ref "/boards" >}} "boards") which are designed with the same form factor and pin [specification](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather/feather-specification). See, for instance, [OrangeCrab](https://github.com/hdl/constraints/tree/main/board/OrangeCrab), [QuickFeather](https://github.com/hdl/constraints/blob/main/board/.todo/QuickFeather.yml) or [iCE40-feather](https://github.com/hdl/constraints/blob/main/board/.todo/iCE40-feather-r0.2.yml).

{{< note >}}
There are wing/plate/baseboard designs to allow using PMOD peripherals with Feather boards. See [PMOD]({{< ref "/items/pmod" >}} "PMOD").
